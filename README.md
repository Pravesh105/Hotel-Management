# Hotel-Management
Absolutely! The "Hotel-Management" project is an innovative microservices-based solution that leverages the power of modern technology to revolutionize hotel management. Comprising six essential microservices, each meticulously crafted, along with advanced tools like OKTA for microservice management and Resilience4j for load balancing, this project redefines the way hotels operate and provide exceptional guest experiences. Here's an overview of the project's key components:

1. **ServiceRegistery:** At the core of the project's architecture, the ServiceRegistery microservice acts as a centralized hub for registering and discovering all other microservices. This seamless interaction ensures that all components can efficiently locate and communicate with one another, forming a tightly integrated ecosystem.

2. **UserService:** The UserService microservice takes charge of user-related operations, enabling seamless user registration, authentication, and profile management. By integrating with OKTA, this microservice ensures robust security and easy management of user accounts across the platform.

3. **ApiGateway:** Serving as the project's gateway to the outside world, the ApiGateway microservice provides a unified interface for external interactions. It skillfully directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservices, enhancing communication efficiency and maintaining a consistent user experience.

4. **HotelService:** The HotelService microservice serves as the operational powerhouse, encompassing functionalities like room availability management, booking handling, service requests, and amenities information. This microservice optimizes hotel operations while keeping guest satisfaction at the forefront.

5. **RatingService:** Empowering guest engagement, the RatingService microservice allows users to share valuable feedback and ratings. This component collects and analyzes guest reviews, offering real-time insights to improve the quality of services provided by the hotel.

6. **ConfigServer:** The ConfigServer microservice brings configurability and adaptability to the forefront. By centralizing configuration settings for other microservices, it simplifies adjustments and updates to system behavior, fostering agility and minimizing disruption.

Moreover, the project's architecture is fortified by the integration of OKTA for microservice management. This ensures secure and streamlined management of user identities, access control, and authentication across the entire ecosystem.

Additionally, Resilience4j takes the spotlight for load balancing, enhancing the system's resilience and performance. This advanced tool intelligently distributes incoming requests among microservices, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring high availability.

In summary, the "Hotel-Management" project ingeniously marries microservices architecture with cutting-edge technologies like OKTA and Resilience4j. By seamlessly integrating ServiceRegistery, UserService, ApiGateway, HotelService, RatingService, and ConfigServer, the project transforms hotel management into a seamless and efficient experience. With a focus on security, performance, and user satisfaction, this project marks a new era in the hospitality industry, setting a high standard for modern hotel management systems.
